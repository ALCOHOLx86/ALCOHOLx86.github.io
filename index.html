  Welcome to BEER POSIXüç∫ , beer is a open sorce brute force binary windows exectutable runtime for intel (x86_64 architecture) computers running a POSIX BSD based Operating System.<br />
  BEER loads a exe into memory and then jumps and runs the executable code. Soon we will be implementing ESSPRESSO into BEER; ESPRESSo is a arbitrary conversion layer that converts Win calls into Posix calls in a dynamic/arbitrary way by wrapping each call in a random set of Posix calls derived from a call index.<br />
</p>
<p>
  ::QUICK DISCLAIMER:: <br />
  Both espresso and beer are currently very unstable, take into account most exes will crash since this is only a experimental project written in base c. <br />

<a href="BEER" download>Download latest release</a>
<p>
  After downloading the binary, cd into the directory were its saved and run this command to add it to your terminal path, <br />
  after this you can use the BEER command to compile and run exe files (very unstable most crash). <br />
  The command to add to PATH: <br />
  <br />
  mv BEER /usr/local/bin/ <br />
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/BEER <br />

::Notices::<br />
After ESPRESSO is implemented into base BEER we will add a new tool called VODKA; <br />
VODKA is a pre compilation of espresso BEER implementations. <br />

VODKA Operates Dynamic Kernels Arbitrarily <br />
