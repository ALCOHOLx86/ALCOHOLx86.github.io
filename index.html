<h1>ALCOHOL FOR POSIX</h1>
<h2>ARBITRARY LAYER for COVERSION with OPERATIONALLY HEAVY OPERATING LAYERS (FOR POSIX)</h2>
<p>Alcohol for posix is a set of two projects (espresso and beer) that combine to creat a third (vodka), <br />
the aim of these projects are to enable windows exes on Posix complient systems.<dr />
</p>

<h1>VODKA for POSIXüç∏</h1>
<h2>VODKA Operates Dynamic Kernels Arbitrarily (for POSIX)</h2>

<p>
Vodka is an implementation of Espresso inside of Beer. Espresso is an arbitrary Win to Posix call translation layer <br />
that takes a Win sys call and wrappes it in an arbitrary Posix call in an attempt to load the exe. <br />

::Downloads:: <br />
::Quick Disclaimer:: <br />
Vodka is in a early stage and exes run on it will likley crash or show random output.<br />

<p>
  Welcome to BEER POSIXüç∫ , beer is a open sorce brute force binary windows exectutable runtime for intel (x86_64 architecture) computers running a POSIX BSD based Operating System.<br />
  BEER loads a exe into memory and then jumps and runs the executable code.<br />
</p>
<p>
  ::QUICK DISCLAIMER:: <br />
  Both espresso and beer are currently very unstable, take into account most exes will crash since this is only a experimental project written in base c. <br />

<p>
  After downloading the binary, cd into the directory were its saved and run this command to add it to your terminal path, <br />
  after this you can use the BEER command to compile and run exe files (very unstable most crash). <br />
  The command to add to PATH: <br />
  <br />
  mv BEER /usr/local/bin/ <br />
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/BEER <br />
