<p>
  Welcome to BEER DOSüç∫ , beer is a open sorce brute force binary windows exectutable runtime for intel (x86_64 architecture) computers running a POSIX BSD based Operating System.<br />
  BEER loads a exe into memory and then jumps and runs the executable code. BEER runs on base ESPRESSO, ESPRESSO is a chaos conversion layer<br />
</p>
<p>
  ::QUICK DISCLAIMER:: <br />
  Both espresso and beer are currently very unstable, take into account most exes will crash since this is only a experimental project written in base c. <br />
